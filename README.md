# 🕶️ Yonathan Jabir

In pursuit of polymathy, I wander between software and industrial design,  
drawn to the elegance of architecture, whether digital or tangible.  
Perfection is both my compass and my burden; every creation,  
a dialogue between form and function, beauty and utility.  

Currently shaping ideas at **Plegma-co**.  
Open to collaborations, challenges, and the unexpected paths they bring.
